## Learning Objectives

- Brief overview of data wrangling
- Importance of data cleaning and preparation

Data wrangling is an essential step in the data analysis process. It involves transforming and mapping data from its raw form into a more suitable format for analysis. The importance of data cleaning and preparation cannot be overstated as it ensures the accuracy and consistency of the data, which are crucial for making reliable and valid conclusions.

## Setup

First, ensure you have the necessary packages installed and loaded. We will use the `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `lubridate`, `stringr`, and `tidyr` packages for our examples. Additionally, we'll use datasets from Kaggle. Make sure you have a Kaggle account and have downloaded the datasets you want to use.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(stringr)
library(tidyr)
```
