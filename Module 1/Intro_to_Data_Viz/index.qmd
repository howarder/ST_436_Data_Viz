## Share a Data Visualization {.smaller}

-   Form groups of 2-3
-   Start by introducing yourself to your group (name, major, why you're taking this class, etc.)
-   As a group, explore one member's data visualization. Answer the following questions:
    -   q1
    -   q2
    -   q3
-   When the timer runs out switch to new group member's visualization and answer the same questions above.

```{r echo=FALSE}
countdown(minutes=5)
```

## webr

```{webr-r}
ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = disp, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point()
```
